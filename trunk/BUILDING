Steps to start from fresh checkout:

From top directory of a line of development (e.g. trunk):

1. libtoolize (only required the first time) (glibtoolize on OS X)
2. aclocal -I m4
3. autoheader
4. automake --add-missing (might need a -f flag before --add-missing, but I didn't)
5. autoconf
6. ./configure
7. make
8. sudo make install (only if you want to install them to default system lib paths and such)

You can also do `autoreconf -i` instead of steps 2-5. At least... it worked on my Mac.
