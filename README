Sick LIDAR Toolbox, forked for CWRU IGVC team

Building trunk:
	install autoconf, automake, libtool, m4
	from trunk dir, run:
		autoreconf -i
		./configure
		make
		sudo make install

To link trunk against your own app after doing a sudo make install, you need to pass -lsicklms2xx as a link flag, not the one specified in the pdf manuals.
